** KAGI Fe Demo
*** Task 1

Two examples (example1.html, example2.html) of the first task can be found in the Task1 directory. They should work in a browser of your choice; they don't use any JavaScript.
For the second example, I tried to figure out a way which would allow me to show the 'Show More' button,
based on whether the text within the element above it had more than 10 lines but couldn't find one.
So I had to rely on making each line of the text an individual element within the DOM to make it work.

*** Task 2

 A script for the second task (task2.js) can be found in the Task2 directory. It contains of four implementations of the court method with a benchmark. The first one is how I would code it in practice. The third one was the fastest on my machine ( Ryzen 7 7700, 32 GB DDR5 6000C40 memory). It relies on the built in string split method and a raw for loop.
 I tried sorting the array and using binary search in the fourth implementation but that was consistently slower. Regular expressions are generally slower than built-in string methods
 so I didn't bother with them.
